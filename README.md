I created this repository and made it public so that you here can see how I write my code in ReactJS. I am currently using CircleCI for continuous integration, and by clicking on the CircleCI badge, you can see more about the building steps.

I am not using any methodology for naming my commits. And ReactJs was not my first choice to create this site, I have already used Hugo, Jekyll and NextJs, but I chose to do with "Pure" React.

Once in a while, I'll refactor this project until I think it's good enough, which is not the case now.

## What do I expect from this project
- Have a place for me to write freely about myself.
- Have a place to showcase the different projects and technologies I've gone through in my career.
- Start a blog to convey my knowledge.

## Why English? If I'm a Brazilian
I'm not fluent in English, but everything I research about technology, I do in English. So if I produce some content, I think it's fair to be in English too, but soon everything you do will also have its proper Portuguese version.
