        I'm a full-stack developer with extensive experience in web development. I seek to develop myself by learning and incorporating new technologies to my current skill set and pre-existing knowledge. My strength is in web development. I have been fortunate to work alongside numerous senior developers in my workplace and have learned a great deal from them as a result. Java and Java EE development has been my focus to this point, but I am also passionate about front-end. I always have quality of the code at the forefront of my mind when I'm in the development process.

        I'm working to be a renowned and reliable professional in the market. I have significant experience with front-end and React, but I am to develop my competence with other technologies. For now, I seek to refine and expand my current skill set while developing my soft skills in order to become a leader in both technical and management domains.

        As for my personal life, I'm a family-oriented person who loves my wife and dog here in Brazil. Since my work is my passion, I always try to stay up-to-date on emerging technologies. When I'm not at work, I like to travel, work on various ongoing projects and learn about mechanics and improving my proficiency with English language

        I truly love web development and I enjoy researching every aspect that is involved, including accessibility and website optimization, such as enhancing page speed.
