      <p>
        I'm a full-stack developer with extensive experience in web development,
        always looking to update myself with new technologies and improve the
        knowledge I already have. I currently live in Brazil with my wife and
        pet.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strength relies on web development. I was fortunate to work with some
        very experienced senior developers in my workplace. Java and Java EE
        development was my focus by now, but I also passionate about front-end.
        I always think of the quality of the code when I'm developing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking to be a recognised professional in the market as a
        reference. I have a great experience with front-end and React, but I'm
        open with other technologies. For now, I seek to prove my skills, to
        become a technical leader soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a family person who loves my wife and dog, always in touch with
        proper technologies. When I'm not at work, I like to travel, develop my
        projects and learn new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love web development, and I like to research the whole environment
        involved, like accessibility and website optimisation. Making slowest
        websites into lightweight ones is something I love to do.
