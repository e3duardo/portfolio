      <p>
        I am a full-stack developer with extensive experience in web
        development, always looking to update myself with new technologies and
        improve the knowledge I already have. I currently live in Brazil with my
        wife and pet, looking for an opportunity to show the best of my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strength relies on web development. I was fortunate to work with some
        very experienced senior developers in my workplace. My focus till now
        has been Java and Java EE development, but I am passionate about the
        front-end, and I'm looking to improve into React and its ecosystem. I
        always think of the quality of the code when I am developing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking to be a recognised professional in the market as a
        reference. I have a good experienced with front-end and React, but I'm
        open with other technologies. For now, I'm seeking to prove my skills,
        to soon become a technical leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a family person who loves my wife and my dog, always in touch with
        proper technologies. When I'm not at work, I like to travel, develop my
        projects and learn new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love web development, and I like to research the whole environment
        involved, like accessibility and website optimisation. Making slowest
        websites into lightweight ones is something I love to do.
