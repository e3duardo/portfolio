      <p>
        I&apos;m a full-stack developer with extensive experience in web
        development. I seek to develop myself by learning and incorporating new
        technologies to my current skill set and pre-existing knowledge. My
        strength is in web development. I have been fortunate to work alongside
        numerous senior developers in my workplace and have learned a great deal
        from them as a result. Java and Java EE development has been my focus to
        this point, but I am also passionate about front-end. I always have
        quality of the code at the forefront of my mind when I&apos;m in the
        development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m working to be a renowned and reliable professional in the
        market. I have significant experience with front-end and React, but I am
        to develop my competence with other technologies. For now, I seek to
        refine and expand my current skill set while developing my soft skills
        in order to become a leader in both technical and management domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for my personal life, I&apos;m a family-oriented person who loves my
        wife and dog here in Brazil. Since my work is my passion, I always try
        to stay up-to-date on emerging technologies. When I&apos;m not at work,
        I like to travel, work on various ongoing projects and learn about
        mechanics and improving my proficiency with English language
      </p>
      <p>
        I truly love web development and I enjoy researching every aspect that
        is involved, including accessibility and website optimization, such as
        enhancing page speed.
