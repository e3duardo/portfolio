              I started here as an IT assistant and in 2016 I migrated to the
              development area. As a systems analyst. I use Java and Java EE
              daily, our projects are developed using VRaptor, JSP, Hibernate,
              MySql and for frontend, we use Bootstrap, JQuery, and various
              plugins. Our main project is the institution&apos;s portal, which
              uses the technologies above, as well as other projects with the
              same stack.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to growing a lot as a web developer here, I was able
              to learn about DevOps, data modeling, and mobile application
              development with PhoneGap.
            </Experience>
            <Experience company="own" season="2008 - today" job="Freelancer">
              I started freelancing in 2008 developing websites and systems
              using technologies like PHP and C #. Later I continued with PHP
              (sometimes WordPress) and started using Ruby on Rails and Jekyll
              in some projects. I am currently focused on React development.
              <br />
              <br />
              In this walk, I learned a lot about website creation, website
              optimization, continuous integration and everything needed to
              create on the web easily and quickly.
